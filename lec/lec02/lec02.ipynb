Notice the `In:` and `Out:` statements to the left of the cells, followed by a number. That number designates the order in which the cell was run. For example, the number `[3]` next to a cell would indicate that this cell is the third cell that has been run in the notebook so far, or that this is the third time you've run this cell if you've re-run the cell multiple times.\n",

While they're not required for this course, keyboard shortuts will greatly improve your quality of life when programming Python (just trust us on this).\n",
