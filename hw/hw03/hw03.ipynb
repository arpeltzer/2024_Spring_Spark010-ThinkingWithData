    "In this homework assignment, you will look at a dataset which shows the number of internet users per country between 1990 and 2020.  The raw data can be found here: https://ourworldindata.org/.  Subsequently we will also attempt to integrate population data from a different source into this work so that we can make better comparisons between the number of internet users in a country with respect to its total population.  The population data across each country can be found here: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL.  Both datasets have been made available on our JupyterHub for you to view.\n",

    "This homework is due on **Wednesday February 21st, at 3:00 PM**. You must submit the assignment on [CatCourses](https://catcourses.ucmerced.edu/courses/31104/assignments/417798). Your assignment can be exported as PDF directly from JupyterHub."
